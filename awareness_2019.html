                                resolve to ensure all countries on the African Continent sign up to the Convention.
                                <br><br>
                                “We are also willing to share our experiences to broaden knowledge and support other
                                states to accede to and subsequently ratify the Convention and are already supporting
                                the Council of Europe in this regard,” she said
                                Already officials from Ghana’s Ministry of Communications have at the request of the
                                Council of Europe, supported missions in Sierra Leone and The Gambia in the regard.

                                is as strong as its weakest link. We need Nigeria, Niger, Kenya, Uganda and all other
                                countries in the region on board to build a strong cyber secure ecosystem for the
                                digital revolution in Africa to succeed. The African Continental Free Trade Area, which
                                has come into force and which will be headquartered in Ghana, will be largely driven by
                                technology. It is crucial to ensure that our collective efforts to criminalize illegal
                                and criminal cyber activity are also continent-wide and indeed global, as we build
                                resilient systems. We must stand together to win the fight against cybercrime!” she
                                declared.

                                Reiterating Ghana’s commitment in securing safe cyberspace, the Ghanaian Minister said
                                “Our current cybersecurity efforts, which are intrinsically linked to our relationship
                                with the Budapest Convention are therefore paramount.

                                not only to secure our digital ecosystem but also to deal with cybercrime,” she added.

                                According to recent statistics, there were 185 million unique mobile subscribers in West
                                Africa by 2018, which is 10 million more than the subscribers in 2017. By 2025, it is
                                estimated that the number of unique subscribers in the region will reach 248 million,
                                taking the subscriber penetration rate to 54%, compared to the existing 48% in 2018.

                                Ghana alone has over 10 million people connected to the internet with more than half of
                                that number being active users on Facebook, excluding Twitter, Instagram and other
                                social media platforms.

                                The figures, she said “can only grow more strongly in the future and the penetration
                                rates in West Africa alone show that we need to work together as a region to secure such
                                digital technologies and put in place measures to ensure that cybercriminal activities
                                and social media abuse do not thrive on our beloved continent.”

                                Data published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in
                                2019, reveals that only 28 countries in Africa have existing legislations on
                                cybercrimes, with 11 countries having draft legislations and 15 without any at all.

                                ensure that the downsides of information communication and technology do not negate the
                                gains made in the present universal digital economy.
                                <br>
                                Noting the sophistication of cyber-attacks and digital payment fraud across the world,
                                he said “it was important we closed ranks to deal with these emerging trends, lest we

                                selfish interest…they have to be relentlessly fought,” the President said at the opening
                                of the 26th edition of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication
                                (SWIFT) African Regional Conference in Accra on Tuesday.

                                Ghana first hosted the conference in 2005. This year’s three-day programme would focus
                                on the evolution of the Africa’s financial industry and enabling the digital economy on
                                the continent.

                                Highlighting the immense potential of technological innovations towards the
                                transformation of economies accorded the world, President Akufo-Addo said African
                                countries had embraced ICT and technology for growth and advancement.

                                Ghana, he said, had leveraged on technology to help reform and improve its institutional
                                and regulatory processes towards the creation of a digital economy, and that the results
                                “is supporting sustained economic growth, and improving the wellbeing of our citizens.”

                                The President told the gathering that Ghana made some modest gains by setting the mode
                                for a digital economy and improved the wellbeing of the people and was rolling out a
                                national identity system which required that a citizen must first have a digital

                                “These biometric national ID cards are being linked to other identification systems and
                                databases, such as social security, driver’s license, and passports, to ensure we have a
                                credible national database,” he added.
                                <br>
                                Additionally, every landed property was being assigned a unique identifier because
                                proper addressing of properties would ensure efficient delivery of services for
                                development.
                                Government, President Akufo-Addo stated, completed the cycle of mobile money payments by
                                linking mobile money wallets to bank accounts and the e-zwich card.
                                <br>
                                The development, he said, created a level playing field for persons with or without bank
                                accounts to conduct financial transactions, and is rapidly promoting financial
                                inclusivity in Ghana, And as a result, the financial industry was witnessing significant
                                growth, and with mobile money penetration in Ghana being the second highest in Africa,
                                evidenced in mobile money transactions worth GH¢213 billion in 2018, up from GH¢78.5
                                billion in 2016.
                                <br>
                                The President was confident that with the raft of digital revolutions and reforms being
                                rolled out by his government,and with his administration committed to having systems to
                                manage all government receipts and payments by 2020, Ghana would have a strong
                                competitive urge in the region for financial innovation and access you credit.
                                <br>
                                He said however in support of the country’s digitisation agenda, that steps were being
                                taken to strengthen the regulatory environment, including the recent financial sector
                                review by the Bank of Ghana (BoG).
                                <br>
                                The Bank of Ghana has reviewed, amended and consolidated all existing payments system,
                                and regulatory frameworks into the new payment system and services act of 2019.
                                <br>
                                The new legislation among other things would ensure that banks, non-banking and
                                financial institutions and especially rural and community banks provided services that
                                would bring banking and financial transactions closer to the public.
                                <br>
                                The President noted that his Government’s agenda of creating a digital economy has
                                naturally been extended to other sectors of the economy, with the introduction of the
                                paperless port system, the e-justice system, and the digitising of land administration
                                services.
                                <br>
                                Just as technology offers opportunities to grow our economies and bring progress to our
                                peoples, the President stressed that there were criminal syndicates bent on exploiting
                                it for their selfish interests, which, he said, had to be relentlessly fought.
                                <br>
                                With SWIFT working with Ghana to reduce vulnerabilities to the external risks, President
                                Akufo-Addo urged the Bank of Ghana to make sure that Ghana’s financial sector remained
                                fit for global integration, by ensuring compliance with international standards.
                                <br>
                                In addition to the establishment of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to oversee
                                and coordinate Ghana’s nation’s cybersecurity programmes, the President noted that “we
                                have developed the Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) ecosystem, and instituted
                                cybersecurity awareness programmes and other initiatives, which have set Ghana on the
                                path to developing a robust national cybersecurity system.”

                            <p>The Minister of Communications, Mrs. Ursula Owusu-Ekuful has assured Ghanaians, that her
                                outfit is assiduously working to ensure the necessary legislation on Cybersecurity is
                                finalised and passed to further strengthen the government’s commitment in the fight
                                against cybercrime.
                                <br><br>
                                Ghana became the 62nd state party of the Convention on Cybercrime in December 2018,
                                following the accession of the Convention by His Excellency the President, Nana Addo
                                Dankwa Akufo-Addo. The accession to the Convention was to facilitate Ghana’s efforts in
                                the fight against cybercrimes through international cooperation and to further
                                strengthen the commitment by the Government to tackle cybercrime and its related issues.
                                <br><br>
                                In view of this, the National Cyber Security Centre of the Ministry of Communications in
                                collaboration with the Council of Europe organised a two-day national conference on
                                March 18-19, 2019 at the Movenpick Ambassador hotel, Accra for the technical
                                implementation of the Convention on Cybercrime also known as Budapest Convention under
                                Result 1.1 (“Cybercrime policies and strategies strengthened and integrated in broader
                                cybersecurity policy frameworks in up to 15 countries (priority and a number of other
                                countries) and experience shared with other countries”), and Activity 1.1.5 (“Provide

                                The conference was to ensure stakeholders foster common understanding and cooperation in
                                the fight against cybercrimes and also sought to raise awareness on opportunities and
                                Ghana’s obligations under the Budapest Convention, both at the domestic and
                                international levels.
                                <br><br>
                                Speaking at the conference, the Hon. Minister for Communications, Mrs. Ursula
                                Owusu-Ekuful bemoaned the need to fight cybercrimes through international recognition
                                and pledged Ghana’s commitment.
                                <br><br>
                                “We have therefore become only the 5th country on the African continent to have acceded
                                to the Convention, after Mauritius, Senegal, Cape Verde and Morocco. We have also
                                ratified the African Union Convention on Cyber Security & Personal Data Protection, also
                                known as the Malabo Convention, being only one of the 3 African countries, which have
                                ratified both the Malabo and Budapest conventions, the other 2 being Mauritius and
                                Senegal. These actions are borne out of our recognition that we need to fight the menace
                                of cybercrime through international cooperation as we can’t go at it alone and we are
                                privileged to work with the Council of Europe through the GLACY+ Project to learn from
                                the experiences of others”, she said.

                                Mrs. Owusu-Ekuful assured stakeholders of the scrupulous efforts her Ministry is
                                undertaking to ensure the necessary legislation on Cybersecurity is finalised and put in
                                place to further strengthen the Ministry and for that matter Government’s commitment to
                                the fight against cybercrime.

                                “I wish to announce that; the Ministry of Communications is currently working on a draft
                                cybersecurity legislation which will address some identified weaknesses in our
                                cybercrime laws and make provisions for appropriate sanctions for non-compliance with
                                our cybersecurity provisions”, she noted.

                                “We are in the process of reviewing our Cybersecurity Policy & Strategy to ensure we
                                have a future proof strategic document to guide our cybersecurity development which
                                constitutes an important safeguard in Ghana’s digitalization agenda. The draft reviewed
                                policy and strategy document is ready and shall be subjected to stakeholder and public
                                consultations next month before being presented for Cabinet’s consideration and
                                adoption. I implore you all to provide inputs to ensure the policy/strategy reflects our
                                collective vision which will safeguard our digital journey”, she added.
                                <br><br>
                                On his part, the National Cybersecurity Advisor, Dr Albert Antwi-Boasiako expressed his
                                appreciation for the excellent leadership exhibited by the Minister on Ghana’s
                                cybersecurity development and how far the country has been led through the political
                                process leading to Ghana’s accession to the Budapest Convention.
                                <br><br>
                                He also acknowledged the commitment by the Council of Europe and all other partners in
                                supporting the country’s cybersecurity journey so far.
                                <br><br>
                                “As a country, we are grateful to have found partnership in the Council of Europe and
                                other partners such as the World Bank, UNICEF, United States Government, Africa Union
                                and our domestic supporter – the National Communications Authority (NCA) in our efforts
                                to address cybercrimes. We are grateful to the Council of Europe for their strong
                                commitment to Ghana especially in the area of capacity building”, he stated.
                                <br><br>
                                The Programmes Manager – Cybercrime Programme Office of the Council of Europe (C-PROC),
                                Mr. Matteo Lucchetti, outlined some statistics which indicated Ghana is ranked 9th among
                                the top ten countries in the world for number of hours spent per day on social media and
                                cautioned participants about some cybercrime activities people encounter online.
                                <br><br>
                                He commended Ghana for the important contribution provided to all the actions developed
                                in the GLACY+ framework and also becoming a priority country since its accession to the

                                fund, in which we have to seed it, to show the seriousness.”
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>Cybercrime Loss</strong><br>
                                He noted that statistics from the Cybercrime Unit of the Criminal Investigations
                                Department (CID) indicates that, in 2016 Ghana had lost about US$25.8 million, with
                                US$8.4 million in the form business compromises. The 2017 estimates put the loss at US$
                                69 million.
                                <br><br>
                                Estimates further shows that as at August this year, Ghana had lost US$97 million due to
                                Cybercrime. This is an indication of increasing cybercrime incidence.
                                <br><br>
                                However, most of these cybercrime cases are often not reported and the country does not
                                have an active setup to calculate such losses.
                                <br><br>
                                “I don’t think I have an option, but to really create that fund so that, we can really
                                begin to get creative on protecting our future and making sure that the whole idea of
                                Ghana becoming the regional hub for trade, tourism and information technology (IT) is
                                then backed by our commitment to protect investors and ourselves,” the minister said.
                                <br><br>
                                He insisted that the amount of money the country expects to spend in digitizing the
                                economy, should justify the need to find resources as required.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>Mobile Money</strong><br>
                                Citing the use of mobile money, Ofori –Atta said that, transactions worth about GHS79
                                billion was carried out in 2016, which grew to nearly 156 billion in 2017, representing
                                a significant growth of almost double.
                                <br><br>
                                Currently the total registered mobile money accounts across the three major telcos have
                                outstripped the country’s total population.
                                <br><br>
                                The latest data from Bank of Ghana’s payment system shows that the registered number of
                                mobile money accounts increased to 29.99 million in June 2018 from 21.36 million
                                recorded in June 2017, representing an increase of 40.40 percent over a one-year period.
                                <br><br>
                                To this end, industry estimates show that 50 percent of the mobile money subscribers
                                have either experienced fraud or are targets for fraudsters.

                                        These are typically the work of hackers, who break into a web server and replace
                                        the hosted website with one of their own. Attackers may have different
                                        motivations when they deface a website. Political motivation is one, which is
                                        often used to spread messages by “cyber protesters” or hacktivists.
                                        Other attackers may choose to deface a website for fun – to mock site owners by
                                        finding website vulnerabilities and exploiting these to deface a website.
                                        In both cases, website owners face damages to their business and reputation once
                                        their sites are defaced.</p>

                                            be gained from Google search results.

                    <p>The internet has provided children with new and innovative ways to learn, develop their skills,
                        communicate efficiently interact socially and entertain themselves. According to a UNICEF
                        estimate by Livingstone, Carr, and Byrne 2015, one third of internet users globally are
                        children, with the proportion of internet users likely to be higher in lower income countries
                        where the internet is rapidly penetrating all spheres of public life. The proliferation of
                        internet access points, mobile technology and the exponential growth of internet-enabled devices
                        combined with the vast resources to be found in cyberspace –provide unparalleled opportunities
                        for children and young people to communicate, connect, share, learn, access information and
                        express their opinions on matters that affect their lives and their communities.<br><br>

                        As confirmed by a national study on child online practices in Ghana through a report
                        commissioned by UNICEF in collaboration with the Government of Ghana, nearly 70% of children use
                        the internet for learning and yet too little is done to protect them. The impact of the internet
                        on the lives of children is a significant concern globally, both in terms of opportunities it
                        provides as well as its potential to put children at risk. Children are more vulnerable in the
                        cyberspace. The dangers confronting them include online abuse in all its forms; cyber bullying,
                        child pornography, sexual exploitation, cyber stalking, access to inappropriate content,
                        gambling for children and a network for child-sex tourism and trafficking and overuse of the
                        internet. This is corroborated by evidence from the children’s online practices research as
                        indicated below.<br><br>

                        To step up national effort aimed at promoting a Safer Digital Ghana, Children have been
                        identified as one of the key targets for the Safer Digital Ghana national awareness campaign.
                        Consequently, Child Online Protection (COP) is a key component of the campaign. The objective of
                        the COP pillar of the Safer Digital Ghana campaign is to create awareness on basic cybersecurity
                        issues related to children and young people, identify the risks and opportunities associated
                        with use of the internet and promote hygienic and safe cyber practices among children. It is
                        expected that by the end of the campaign in 2024, children in Ghana would have increased
                        knowledge and understanding on basic cybersecurity skills and will be able to use the internet
                        in a safe and responsible manner.

                        The Global Cyber Security Index (GCSI) reported in 2016 that about half the world’s population
                        (3.5 billion) used the internet and estimated that by the year 2020 devices connected to the
                        internet will be well over 12 billion. An annual report released by Global Digital Agencies
                        revealed that about 10.11M Ghanaians are reported to be using the internet, representing 35% of
                        the population , a two million increase in the figure recorded in January 2017. This increase
                        directly affects the volume and impact of cybercrime activities in our ecosystem.

                        Increasing Connected World”, revealed that 61% of the people surveyed were more worried about
                        how secure their information was now than they were five years ago. Despite these growing fears
                        and worries, only 37% have signed up for an identity theft protection solution. Further, 33%
                        admitted they did not have an idea about cybersecurity risks. Information provided to online
                        accounts to access personal data opens people up to varying degrees of cyber-attacks.
                        <br><br>
                        On a global scale, according to Norton Cybersecurity Insights Report in 2017, 978 million people
                        in 20 countries were affected by cybercrime with 44% of consumers impacted in the last 12
                        months. The report also mentioned common cybercrimes experienced by the public including; device
                        infection by a virus (53%), debit or credit card fraud (38%), account password compromise (34%),
                        hacking of email or social media account (34%), online purchase scams (33%), and phishing
                        attacks (32%). The situation in Ghana is no different. According to analysis conducted by the
                        National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the public continue to experience all forms of cybercrime
                        and online abuse including mobile money fraud, identity theft, sextortion, business scams,
                        social media impersonation and other social engineering related tricks.
                        <br><br>
                        Consequently, this campaign focus area will engage the citizenry to create awareness towards
                        educating individuals and groups to understand their roles and responsibilities in ensuring a
                        safer digital life. The awareness will focus on cybercrime risks for the public, cyber hygiene
                        practices by individual users, cyber responsibilities of citizens and the rights of the citizens
                        under the Data Protection Act (Act 843).

                    <p>Cybercrime continues to affect all sectors of the business community in Ghana. Whilst big
                        corporations have implemented essential cybersecurity measures, Small to Medium Enterprises
                        (SMEs) which represent a significant portion of business in Ghana do not have adequate
                        cybersecurity measures in place. This picture is no different from the global picture. For
                        example, the Consumer News and Business Channel (CNBC) published a report on <strong>“Local
                            businesses a
                            target for next cyber-attacks”</strong> in October 2017. Their findings revealed that nearly
                        6 in 10
                        small businesses reported that they have experienced a cyberattack. A survey by Nationwide on
                        small-business owners found only 13% of respondents believed they had experienced a cyberattack.
                        However when these owners were given specific examples of attacks including phishing, viruses
                        and ransomware, those reporting attacks increased to 58%.
                        <br><br>
                        The above findings explain the need for cybercrime awareness among businesses especially SMEs,
                        to recognize the risks, identify the threats and take preventive measures to prevent
                        cyber-attacks.
                        <br><br>
                        Even though all typologies of businesses suffer cyber-attacks, some sectors especially the
                        financial sector suffer the most. According to Nippon
                        Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) 2018 report on “Global Threat Intelligence”, the top 5
                        industry sectors to suffer an increase in cyber-attacks since 2016 were finance, technology,
                        professional services, manufacturing and retail. Of these, most crimes were executed by spyware,
                        trojans and viruses.
                        <br><br>

                        In Ghana, the cybersecurity landscape has evolved dynamically. In a somewhat multifaceted
                        occurrence, this has caused the unauthorized disclosure of a trove of personal and confidential
                        information costing millions of cedis in financial losses. A survey by Better Business Bureau
                        (BBB), indicates about a quarter of small-business respondents had not heard of phishing, a
                        third had not heard of ransomware, and nearly half had not heard of point-of-sale malware.
                        Meanwhile, Point-of Sale systems were involved in three-quarters of cyber-attacks involving the
                        hotel and restaurant industry according to the BBB. Their survey showed that hackers mainly
                        attack small businesses to gain access to data and information on customers and employees.
                        <br><br>
                        Evidence suggests small firms may not suffer a direct hit from cyber criminals’ but may be used
                        indirectly to attack big corporates. This has proven to be quite an effective criminal tactic
                        because of the delusion that their size keeps them safe.
                        <br><br>
                        As cybersecurity is the most prevalent risk issue faced by organizations worldwide today, there
                        is therefore the need for the government to engage with the industry to mitigate the risk. This
                        campaign focus area will be highly customized to address specific industry cybersecurity
                        concerns. The NCSC will engage with business and industry groups and associations to implement
                        the awareness campaign.

                    <p>Government has the key responsibility to maintain the security of Ghana’s critical
                        infrastructures, internet services and the entire digital ecosystem. Government senior executive
                        must buy into cybersecurity and its funding; technical personnel must understand the threats at
                        the technical level and how to mitigate the risks; government employees who are the end users
                        must also understand the threats of their actions and how their inaction could open them up to
                        cyber-attacks. An integrated approach must be used in creating awareness on cybersecurity in the
                        Government sector.
                        <br><br>
                        It is easy to perceive that cybersecurity incidents are on the increase and government will
                        remain a prime target. A report on cyber-attacks directed against the U.S. government in Fiscal
                        Year 2017 by attack vector revealed that the U.S. government encountered 7,328 e-mail or
                        phishing attacks, 4,049 web attacks and 4,395 loss or theft of equipment. In Ghana,
                        cyber-attacks such as , phishing, and website defacement, have been encountered by some
                        government agencies. It is therefore imperative that awareness is created at all levels in
                        government; senior level (including public officials and civil servants), technical (IT)
                        personnel, and government employees (end users).
                        <br><br>
                        Government should be able to build and implement resilient systems that have less
                        vulnerabilities. Report from Shadow Servers reveals Ghana’s cybersecurity vulnerabilities over
                        the last weeks in the figure below;
                        <br><br>

                        The top three incidents per the report showed an abuse of Internet Protocol (IP) space, improper
                        configurations of network infrastructure leading to botnets and irregular time synchronization
                        of network systems within organizations. It is important that government implement systems to
                        identify and patch known vulnerabilities to have dependable systems. These technical measures
                        require awareness on cybersecurity risks in government as it will also facilitate relevant
                        funding required to implement such technical remediation measures.
                        <br><br>
                        Cybersecurity awareness in government is particularly important because the government is the
                        biggest data controller of the citizens personal
                        information. There are also sensitive government data which ought to be protected from both
                        internal and external malicious actors. Awareness
                        creation will lead to better appreciation of the risks and it is expected to positively impact
                        on user behavior towards a responsible cyber culture in government. Consequently, awareness
                        campaign programme will be initiated to provide adequate support for government officials. The
                        awareness programme for Senior & Executive Officials will be dubbed Government Cybersecurity
                        Leaders Awareness Programme; Technical Officials programme will be dubbed Government
                        Cybersecurity Champions Awareness Programme; and Government Employee’s program will be
                        Government Cyber Hygiene Programme. Through these programmes, the capacity of government and
                        public officials will be built to ensure that all government employees adhere to government
                        cybersecurity guidelines.
