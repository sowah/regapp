                                structures and processes without a corresponding focus on cybersecurity, hence Ghana’s
                                resolve to ensure all countries on the African Continent sign up to the Convention.

                                “We are also willing to share our experiences to broaden knowledge and support other
                                states to accede to and subsequently ratify the Convention and are already supporting
                                the Council of Europe in this regard,” she said
                                Already officials from Ghana’s Ministry of Communications have at the request of the
                                Council of Europe, supported missions in Sierra Leone and The Gambia in the regard.

                                “We intend to continue to ensure we collectively secure our digital economy, as a chain
                                is as strong as its weakest link. We need Nigeria, Niger, Kenya, Uganda and all other
                                countries in the region on board to build a strong cyber secure ecosystem for the
                                digital revolution in Africa to succeed. The African Continental Free Trade Area, which
                                has come into force and which will be headquartered in Ghana, will be largely driven by
                                technology. It is crucial to ensure that our collective efforts to criminalize illegal
                                and criminal cyber activity are also continent-wide and indeed global, as we build
                                resilient systems. We must stand together to win the fight against cybercrime!” she
                                declared.

                                Reiterating Ghana’s commitment in securing safe cyberspace, the Ghanaian Minister said
                                “Our current cybersecurity efforts, which are intrinsically linked to our relationship
                                with the Budapest Convention are therefore paramount.

                                “Ghana’s ratification of the Budapest Convention in itself complements the African Union
                                Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (Malabo Convention), which
                                requires us, as a state party, to ensure the implementation of relevant legal measures
                                not only to secure our digital ecosystem but also to deal with cybercrime,” she added.
                                <br><br>
                                According to recent statistics, there were 185 million unique mobile subscribers in West
                                Africa by 2018, which is 10 million more than the subscribers in 2017. By 2025, it is
                                estimated that the number of unique subscribers in the region will reach 248 million,
                                taking the subscriber penetration rate to 54%, compared to the existing 48% in 2018.

                                Ghana alone has over 10 million people connected to the internet with more than half of
                                that number being active users on Facebook, excluding Twitter, Instagram and other
                                social media platforms.

                                The figures, she said “can only grow more strongly in the future and the penetration
                                rates in West Africa alone show that we need to work together as a region to secure such
                                digital technologies and put in place measures to ensure that cybercriminal activities
                                and social media abuse do not thrive on our beloved continent.”

                                Data published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in
                                2019, reveals that only 28 countries in Africa have existing legislations on
                                cybercrimes, with 11 countries having draft legislations and 15 without any at all.

                                cybersecurity efforts,” she said.

                            <p>President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has called for stronger global collaboration to
                                ensure that the downsides of information communication and technology do not negate the
                                gains made in the present universal digital economy.
                                <br>
                                Noting the sophistication of cyber-attacks and digital payment fraud across the world,
                                he said “it was important we closed ranks to deal with these emerging trends, lest we
                                risk the erosion of confidence in the financial payments system.”
                                <br>
                                “Just as technology offers opportunities to grow our economy and bring progress to our
                                people, there are criminal syndicates who will always be bent on exploiting it for their
                                selfish interest…they have to be relentlessly fought,” the President said at the opening
                                of the 26th edition of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication
                                (SWIFT) African Regional Conference in Accra on Tuesday.
                                <br>
                                Ghana first hosted the conference in 2005. This year’s three-day programme would focus
                                on the evolution of the Africa’s financial industry and enabling the digital economy on
                                the continent.
                                <br>
                                Highlighting the immense potential of technological innovations towards the
                                transformation of economies accorded the world, President Akufo-Addo said African
                                countries had embraced ICT and technology for growth and advancement.
                                <br>
                                Ghana, he said, had leveraged on technology to help reform and improve its institutional
                                and regulatory processes towards the creation of a digital economy, and that the results
                                “is supporting sustained economic growth, and improving the wellbeing of our citizens.”
                                <br>
                                The President told the gathering that Ghana made some modest gains by setting the mode
                                for a digital economy and improved the wellbeing of the people and was rolling out a
                                national identity system which required that a citizen must first have a digital
                                property address among others.
                                <br>
                                “These biometric national ID cards are being linked to other identification systems and
                                databases, such as social security, driver’s license, and passports, to ensure we have a
                                credible national database,” he added.
                                <br>
                                Additionally, every landed property was being assigned a unique identifier because
                                proper addressing of properties would ensure efficient delivery of services for
                                development.
                                Government, President Akufo-Addo stated, completed the cycle of mobile money payments by
                                linking mobile money wallets to bank accounts and the e-zwich card.
                                <br>
                                The development, he said, created a level playing field for persons with or without bank
                                accounts to conduct financial transactions, and is rapidly promoting financial
                                inclusivity in Ghana, And as a result, the financial industry was witnessing significant
                                growth, and with mobile money penetration in Ghana being the second highest in Africa,
                                evidenced in mobile money transactions worth GH¢213 billion in 2018, up from GH¢78.5
                                billion in 2016.
                                <br>
                                The President was confident that with the raft of digital revolutions and reforms being
                                rolled out by his government,and with his administration committed to having systems to
                                manage all government receipts and payments by 2020, Ghana would have a strong
                                competitive urge in the region for financial innovation and access you credit.
                                <br>
                                He said however in support of the country’s digitisation agenda, that steps were being
                                taken to strengthen the regulatory environment, including the recent financial sector
                                review by the Bank of Ghana (BoG).
                                <br>
                                The Bank of Ghana has reviewed, amended and consolidated all existing payments system,
                                and regulatory frameworks into the new payment system and services act of 2019.
                                <br>
                                The new legislation among other things would ensure that banks, non-banking and
                                financial institutions and especially rural and community banks provided services that
                                would bring banking and financial transactions closer to the public.
                                <br>
                                The President noted that his Government’s agenda of creating a digital economy has
                                naturally been extended to other sectors of the economy, with the introduction of the
                                paperless port system, the e-justice system, and the digitising of land administration
                                services.
                                <br>
                                Just as technology offers opportunities to grow our economies and bring progress to our
                                peoples, the President stressed that there were criminal syndicates bent on exploiting
                                it for their selfish interests, which, he said, had to be relentlessly fought.
                                <br>
                                With SWIFT working with Ghana to reduce vulnerabilities to the external risks, President
                                Akufo-Addo urged the Bank of Ghana to make sure that Ghana’s financial sector remained
                                fit for global integration, by ensuring compliance with international standards.
                                <br>
                                In addition to the establishment of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to oversee
                                and coordinate Ghana’s nation’s cybersecurity programmes, the President noted that “we
                                have developed the Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) ecosystem, and instituted
                                cybersecurity awareness programmes and other initiatives, which have set Ghana on the
                                path to developing a robust national cybersecurity system.”

                                Dankwa Akufo-Addo. The accession to the Convention was to facilitate Ghana’s efforts in

                                collaboration with the Council of Europe organised a two-day national conference on
                                March 18-19, 2019 at the Movenpick Ambassador hotel, Accra for the technical
                                implementation of the Convention on Cybercrime also known as Budapest Convention under
                                Result 1.1 (“Cybercrime policies and strategies strengthened and integrated in broader
                                cybersecurity policy frameworks in up to 15 countries (priority and a number of other
                                countries) and experience shared with other countries”), and Activity 1.1.5 (“Provide
                                country-specific advice on policies/strategies and preparation of annual report on
                                cybercrime in pilot countries”) of the GLACY+ (Global Action on Cybercrime Extended)
                                Project – an European Union and Council of Europe project.
                                <br><br>
                                The conference was to ensure stakeholders foster common understanding and cooperation in
                                the fight against cybercrimes and also sought to raise awareness on opportunities and
                                Ghana’s obligations under the Budapest Convention, both at the domestic and
                                international levels.
                                <br><br>
                                Speaking at the conference, the Hon. Minister for Communications, Mrs. Ursula
                                Owusu-Ekuful bemoaned the need to fight cybercrimes through international recognition
                                and pledged Ghana’s commitment.
                                <br><br>
                                “We have therefore become only the 5th country on the African continent to have acceded
                                to the Convention, after Mauritius, Senegal, Cape Verde and Morocco. We have also
                                ratified the African Union Convention on Cyber Security & Personal Data Protection, also
                                known as the Malabo Convention, being only one of the 3 African countries, which have
                                ratified both the Malabo and Budapest conventions, the other 2 being Mauritius and
                                Senegal. These actions are borne out of our recognition that we need to fight the menace
                                of cybercrime through international cooperation as we can’t go at it alone and we are
                                privileged to work with the Council of Europe through the GLACY+ Project to learn from
                                the experiences of others”, she said.
                                <br><br>
                                Mrs. Owusu-Ekuful assured stakeholders of the scrupulous efforts her Ministry is
                                undertaking to ensure the necessary legislation on Cybersecurity is finalised and put in
                                place to further strengthen the Ministry and for that matter Government’s commitment to
                                the fight against cybercrime.
                                <br><br>
                                “I wish to announce that; the Ministry of Communications is currently working on a draft
                                cybersecurity legislation which will address some identified weaknesses in our
                                cybercrime laws and make provisions for appropriate sanctions for non-compliance with
                                our cybersecurity provisions”, she noted.
                                <br><br>
                                “We are in the process of reviewing our Cybersecurity Policy & Strategy to ensure we
                                have a future proof strategic document to guide our cybersecurity development which
                                constitutes an important safeguard in Ghana’s digitalization agenda. The draft reviewed
                                policy and strategy document is ready and shall be subjected to stakeholder and public
                                consultations next month before being presented for Cabinet’s consideration and
                                adoption. I implore you all to provide inputs to ensure the policy/strategy reflects our
                                collective vision which will safeguard our digital journey”, she added.
                                <br><br>
                                On his part, the National Cybersecurity Advisor, Dr Albert Antwi-Boasiako expressed his
                                appreciation for the excellent leadership exhibited by the Minister on Ghana’s
                                cybersecurity development and how far the country has been led through the political
                                process leading to Ghana’s accession to the Budapest Convention.
                                <br><br>
                                He also acknowledged the commitment by the Council of Europe and all other partners in
                                supporting the country’s cybersecurity journey so far.
                                <br><br>
                                “As a country, we are grateful to have found partnership in the Council of Europe and
                                other partners such as the World Bank, UNICEF, United States Government, Africa Union
                                and our domestic supporter – the National Communications Authority (NCA) in our efforts
                                to address cybercrimes. We are grateful to the Council of Europe for their strong
                                commitment to Ghana especially in the area of capacity building”, he stated.
                                <br><br>
                                The Programmes Manager – Cybercrime Programme Office of the Council of Europe (C-PROC),
                                Mr. Matteo Lucchetti, outlined some statistics which indicated Ghana is ranked 9th among
                                the top ten countries in the world for number of hours spent per day on social media and
                                cautioned participants about some cybercrime activities people encounter online.
                                <br><br>
                                He commended Ghana for the important contribution provided to all the actions developed
                                in the GLACY+ framework and also becoming a priority country since its accession to the
                                convention.

                            <p>Finance minister, Ken Ofori-Atta has revealed that government would be introducing yet
                                another fund- the Cyber Security Fund, as part of the 2019 budget, to ensure that there
                                is enough funding for the cyber security setup in the country.
                                <br><br>
                                This follows the President’s assurance on Monday, 22nd of October, 2018 at the formal
                                launch, that government would provide the needed funding for the cyber security setup in
                                the country, to ensure a safe information technological ecosystem.
                                <br><br>
                                Addressing delegates at the climax week of the National Cyber Security Awareness Month
                                in Accra, on Wednesday, Ofori-Atta said it is a shared responsibility between users and
                                government to protect the nation, adding: “we would like to launch a cyber security
                                fund, in which we have to seed it, to show the seriousness.”
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>Cybercrime Loss</strong><br>
                                He noted that statistics from the Cybercrime Unit of the Criminal Investigations
                                Department (CID) indicates that, in 2016 Ghana had lost about US$25.8 million, with
                                US$8.4 million in the form business compromises. The 2017 estimates put the loss at US$
                                69 million.
                                <br><br>
                                Estimates further shows that as at August this year, Ghana had lost US$97 million due to
                                Cybercrime. This is an indication of increasing cybercrime incidence.
                                <br><br>
                                However, most of these cybercrime cases are often not reported and the country does not
                                have an active setup to calculate such losses.
                                <br><br>
                                “I don’t think I have an option, but to really create that fund so that, we can really
                                begin to get creative on protecting our future and making sure that the whole idea of
                                Ghana becoming the regional hub for trade, tourism and information technology (IT) is
                                then backed by our commitment to protect investors and ourselves,” the minister said.
                                <br><br>
                                He insisted that the amount of money the country expects to spend in digitizing the
                                economy, should justify the need to find resources as required.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>Mobile Money</strong><br>
                                Citing the use of mobile money, Ofori –Atta said that, transactions worth about GHS79
                                billion was carried out in 2016, which grew to nearly 156 billion in 2017, representing
                                a significant growth of almost double.
                                <br><br>
                                Currently the total registered mobile money accounts across the three major telcos have
                                outstripped the country’s total population.
                                <br><br>
                                The latest data from Bank of Ghana’s payment system shows that the registered number of
                                mobile money accounts increased to 29.99 million in June 2018 from 21.36 million
                                recorded in June 2017, representing an increase of 40.40 percent over a one-year period.
                                <br><br>
                                To this end, industry estimates show that 50 percent of the mobile money subscribers
                                have either experienced fraud or are targets for fraudsters.
